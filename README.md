### DeepLabv3 for semantic segmentation
DeepLabv3 (and DeepLabv3 plus) is a state-of-the-art model for performing semantic segmentation, which is the task of labeling each pixel of the input image with a predicted semantic class (e.g. car, dog, table). This is a TensorFlow implementation of DeepLabv3 (and plus) that supports training, evaluating and making inference using a trained model.
